SiEd-Dana KNOWN ISSUES (as of SiEd-Dana-beta4)

* Will most likely contain any bugs that were already present in the original SiEd-0.10-beta3 release.
* Does not handle the Dana's Screen Rotate functionality very well; will edit and render text off-screen once the cursor goes past 160 pixels when using in vertical mode. For now, use SiEd-Dana in normal display mode and avoid rotating the screen.
* Let me know if you find anything else by filing a report on GitHub!
